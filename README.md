### Create an AI-Powered Solana Trading Agent with Anthropic’s MCP — Part I
By 8 Bit · 

#### Welcome to the Tutorial Series
In this three-part guide, we’ll leverage Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build an AI agent that trades tokens on the Solana blockchain, guided by real-time market data and risk assessments. Here’s the roadmap:  
- **Part I**: Introduction to MCP and creating your first MCP server  
- **Part II**: Linking MCP servers for trading operations  
- **Part III**: Assembling a fully autonomous Solana trading agent  

Through practical examples, you’ll learn how MCP enables AI agents to tackle complex tasks by integrating diverse data sources and tools seamlessly.

#### Our Goal: Safe Solana Trading
We’re building an AI agent with a specific mission:  
- Trade tokens on Solana (e.g., SOL/USDC pair).  
- Assess token risks using the Solana Tracker API’s risk scores and rug-check data—like liquidity, ownership concentration, and security flags—to avoid scams and rugged projects.  
- Start with an initial SOL investment and track returns over a few days.  

#### Tools We’ll Need
- **Anthropic’s MCP**: The foundation of our project.  
- **Solana Tracker API**: For token prices, liquidity, and risk scores (requires an API key).  
- **Additional tools**: Web searches and Solana blockchain analytics for deeper insights.  

#### MCP Explained: The Basics
Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that simplifies how AI systems connect to external data and tools. Think of it as a universal connector that lets large language models (LLMs) tap into real-world resources effortlessly.

##### Why Use MCP?
Building AI agents often involves juggling APIs, data feeds, and custom integrations. MCP streamlines this with a standardized, lightweight approach:  
- **Easy Integration**: Connect tools without endless custom code.  
- **Fast Responses**: Direct data access boosts AI speed and accuracy.  
- **Wide Compatibility**: Works across AI models and platforms.  

##### How MCP Works
MCP operates on a client-server model:  
- **MCP Servers**: Small programs that expose data or tools (e.g., APIs, blockchain queries) in MCP’s format.  
- **MCP Clients**: AI apps that use these servers to access resources.  
You can build servers with Python or TypeScript SDKs, defining what the AI can access. Compatible clients include Claude Desktop, Cursor, and LibreChat.

##### MCP Today
Since its November 2024 launch, MCP is gaining momentum:  
- **Early Adopters**: Companies like Block and tools like Zed are embracing it.  
- **Open-Source Growth**: Over 1,100 pre-built MCP servers connect to platforms like GitHub and Google Drive.  

##### Why MCP Fits Solana Trading
MCP excels at linking AI to blockchain data—like Solana’s token metrics and risk profiles. This is perfect for trading, enabling real-time access to tools like the Solana Tracker API for prices and risk scores or SendAI’s Agent Kit for blockchain actions (e.g., swaps). See Anthropic’s MCP workshop for more.

#### Hands-On: Build Your First MCP Server
Let’s create an MCP server to fetch Solana token data and risk scores using the Solana Tracker API. You’ll need an API key—sign up at [Solana Tracker](https://solanatracker.io) first.

##### Step 1: Set Up the Server
Clone Anthropic’s quickstart repo, test it, then create a file named `solana_risk_trader.py` with this code:

```python
from typing import Any
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("solana_risk_trader")

# Solana Tracker API setup
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your Solana Tracker API key
BASE_URL = "https://data.solanatracker.io"
HEADERS = {"x-api-key": API_KEY, "accept": "application/json"}

@mcp.tool()
async def get_token_risk(token_address: str) -> str:
    """Fetch price, liquidity, and risk data for a Solana token.
    
    Args:
        token_address: Token mint address (e.g., 'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112')
    """
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/tokens/{token_address}"
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            
            # Extract key metrics
            price_usd = data["pools"][0]["price"]["usd"] if data["pools"] else "N/A"
            liquidity_usd = data["pools"][0]["liquidity"]["usd"] if data["pools"] else "N/A"
            market_cap_usd = data["pools"][0]["marketCap"]["usd"] if data["pools"] else "N/A"
            risk_data = data.get("risk", {})
            risk_score = risk_data.get("score", "N/A")
            risks = risk_data.get("risks", [])
            
            # Format output
            output = [
                f"Token: {data['token']['name']} ({data['token']['symbol']})",
                f"Price (USD): {price_usd}",
                f"Liquidity (USD): {liquidity_usd}",
                f"Market Cap (USD): {market_cap_usd}",
                f"Risk Score (1-10): {risk_score}",
                "Risk Factors:"
            ]
            
            for risk in risks:
                output.append(f"- {risk['name']}: {risk['description']} (Level: {risk['level']}, Score: {risk['score']})")
            
            if risk_data.get("rugged", False):
                output.append("WARNING: Token is flagged as rugged - no liquidity, avoid trading!")
            
            return "\n".join(output) if output else "No data available"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

This server fetches token price, liquidity, market cap, and risk data (e.g., "Freeze Authority Enabled," "Low Liquidity") from the Solana Tracker API.

##### Step 2: Connect to Claude Desktop
Add this to your Claude Desktop config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "solana_risk_trader": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/YOUR/PROJECT/PATH/",
                "run",
                "solana_risk_trader.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Update the path, restart Claude Desktop, and ask: “What’s the risk profile for SOL (So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112)?” It’ll return the data.

##### Bonus: Check Token Holders
Let’s add a tool to analyze holder concentration, a key risk factor. Append this to `solana_risk_trader.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_token_holders(token_address: str) -> str:
    """Fetch top holders and ownership concentration for a Solana token.
    
    Args:
        token_address: Token mint address
    """
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/tokens/{token_address}/holders/top"
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            
            # Analyze top holders
            output = ["Top Holders:"]
            total_supply = sum(holder["amount"] for holder in data)  # Approximate total supply from top holders
            for holder in data[:10]:  # Top 10 holders
                percentage = holder["percentage"]
                output.append(f"- {holder['address']}: {percentage:.2f}%")
                
                # Check ownership concentration risks
                if percentage > 90:
                    output.append("DANGER: Single holder owns >90% of supply (Score: 7000)")
                elif percentage > 50:
                    output.append("DANGER: Single holder owns >50% of supply (Score: 4300)")
                elif percentage > 20:
                    output.append("DANGER: Single holder owns >20% of supply (Score: 2500)")
            
            top_10_percentage = sum(holder["percentage"] for holder in data[:10])
            if top_10_percentage > 15:
                output.append("DANGER: Top 10 holders own >15% of supply (Score: 5000)")
            
            return "\n".join(output) if output else "No holder data available"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

Restart Claude Desktop—now you’ve got tools for risk scores and holder analysis!

##### Tap Into Remote MCP Servers
Add a remote server like Search1API for web searches to complement risk data. Get a free API key, then update your config:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "solana_risk_trader": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": ["--directory", "/YOUR/PROJECT/PATH/", "run", "solana_risk_trader.py"]
        },
        "search1api": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "search1api-mcp"],
            "env": {"SEARCH1API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY"}
        }
    }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to access both tools.

##### Test It All Together
With price, liquidity, risk scores, and holder data ready, try this prompt in Claude Desktop:

**Prompt**: “I’m a Solana trader. Evaluate the SOL/USDC pair for trading over the next 7 days using current price, liquidity, and risk data.”

Watch it pull and analyze everything—no extra coding needed. That’s MCP’s strength.
